# YouTube Auto Speed

A userscript that automatically plays YouTube videos at high speed, except for music.

## Features

- **Fast playback (2.7x)** for regular videos
- **Normal playback (1.0x)** for music content
- **Manual override buttons** in the YouTube header for quick speed adjustment

## How It Works

### Speed Selection

| Content Type | Speed |
|--------------|-------|
| Regular videos | 2.7x |
| YouTube Shorts | 2.7x |
| Music | 1.0x |

### Music Detection

A video is considered music if it meets **any** of the following criteria:

1. **Title contains music-related keywords:**
   - MV
   - カラオケ / karaoke
   - 歌ってみた
   - 歌枠

2. **Duration is 6 minutes or less**
   - Short videos are often music content
   - Exception: YouTube Shorts are always played at 2.7x speed

### Manual Override

Since automatic detection isn't perfect, speed buttons (`x1.0` and `x2.7`) are displayed next to the YouTube logo in the top-left corner of the page. Click them to manually adjust the playback speed when needed.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager (e.g., [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/))
2. Click on `youtube-auto-speed.user.js` or create a new script and paste the code
3. Save and enjoy!
